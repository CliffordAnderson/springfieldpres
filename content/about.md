We are a thriving congregation in Springfield, a growing community northwest of Nashville. We welcome newcomers. By God’s grace, we have discovered Christ’s renewing power that has changed our lives. Through worship and study, we gain encouragement to reach out in service to others where God has called us.

First Presbyterian is the oldest church in continuous operation in Robertson County, originating in 1839 and located on the town square.

Our mission is to be the heart of Christ in the heart of Springfield by

1. providing Bible-based, traditional Presbyterian worship experiences with a variety of non-traditional elements  

1. nurturing Christ-centered leaders who develop disciples of Jesus Christ;

1. leveraging our physical location to reach those in our wider community with the good news of God’s love for all people.

You will find our church building lit up for use by local organizations such as the Rotary Club. We host a variety of community events through the year and concerts that highlight the recently tonally renovated 100-year old organ and other instruments.

Our pastor, the Rev. Dr. Rosanna Anderson, began ministry here in May 2020.

First Presbyterian Church is a member church of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in the Presbytery of Middle Tennessee.
