# Health and Safety Guidelines

For the safety of others and the community as a whole:

* Everyone must wear a mask while at church apart from the celebration of the Lordâ€™s Supper.
* Please bring a mask with you to worship. If you do not bring a mask, the ushers will provide one at the door.

These precautions apply to everyone, including those who have received vaccinations. If anyone prefers not to wear a mask or cannot wear a mask for medical reasons, we respectfully ask that he or she worship at home until the Session deems that masks are no longer required for the safe conduct of public worship.

*These guidelines were approved by the Session at their April 2021 meeting.*

## Adult Education

Adults continue learning and applying the Bible and Reformed theology to their lives in weekly Sunday school classes at 10:00.

Other seasonal opportunities for education and discussion include Lunch and Learn and Advent Bites.
