# Reading “Ruth” with Pastor Rosanna

*Wednesday afternoons at 2:00 p.m.* 

Do you remember Ruth? In a time of drought and famine, Ruth’s dear husband died. What a heavy loss! Her mother-in-law planned to move back to her home country, Israel-- a land that Ruth had never seen. What would she do?  

We all have faced a time in our life when we were at a crossroads and it wasn’t clear what was the best path to take. Today we may feel a lack of choices while we shelter at home to reduce the rate of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

But perhaps the Lord is giving us this time to slow down, to look more closely at how best to live our life, to consider how to nurture our relationships, to think in new ways about what we could do with the resources God has entrusted to us, and to recognize the ways that God is calling us to respond in faith.

“Ruth,” this short but powerful book of the Bible, is an adventure saga that can teach us a lot about loyalty in tough times, friendship, and family-- and discovering God’s providence for an individual and a whole community of faith. Ruth, a foreigner from Moab who was willing to take a leap of faith, became a significant ancestor in the line of King David and Jesus himself!

Each week we will talk about one chapter of Ruth and how it applies to our lives. We will meet via Zoom on Wednesdays May 20, May 27, June 3, and June 10 at 2:00 p.m. The link for the meeting with be on the church’s Facebook page. All you need is a Bible. I hope that you will be able to join me in this meaningful time together.
