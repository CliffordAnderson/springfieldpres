We serve in partnership through intergenerational service programs such as preparing and serving meals at the local soup kitchen, The Masterâ€™s Table. We also collect school bags for Project Joy.

Mission opportunities we support include Meals on Wheels and COPE, Inc., a thrift shop ministry to the wider community on Main Street.

The finance committee also designs budgeted church giving to reflect our mission through national and international giving.
